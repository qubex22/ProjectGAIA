tralnx
======

About
-----
tralnx is a traccar client for GNU/Linux written initially by Thomas Liske <thomas@fiasko-nw.net> and modified by Daniel Till.
It uses gpsd(8) to retrieve and 
send the current GPS location to a traccar[1] server instance.

tralnx rudimentary implements parts of the Skypatrol protocol (only the
required stuff to get it working with traccar). The protocol uses
udp port 5021.


Installation
------------

The following perl modules are required:

Log::Dispatch
Net::GPSD3
Proc::Daemon
Proc::PID::File

Net::GPSD3 uses GPS::Point. tralnxd uses the GPS::Point method to
calculate distances - you need the following addtional packages:

Geo::Inverse
Geo::Constants
Geo::Ellipsoids
Geo::Functions

On Debian those libs are not packaged, you need to fetch them from CPAN[2]
by yourself.
