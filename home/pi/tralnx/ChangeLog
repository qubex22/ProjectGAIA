tralnx (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * made some small improovements:
   - avoid sending invalid GPS data in case of no GPS-signal (long=0 and lat=0) this wouln't be necessary if
     the traccar server would handle invalid data correctly
     but for now (traccar version 3.7) it shows up in route and so miscalculates the trip distance
     
   - script continues working also if internet is interrupted or absent on start.
